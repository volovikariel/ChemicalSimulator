# ChemicalSimulator
Final Project Cegep

To properly run this application (located in the **RELEASE** folder):
1. JRE must be installed on the computer running it
2. Run the **ChemicalSimulator.exe** file
3. If there is an error or you just see the logo then nothing, run the **ChemicalSimulator.bat** file

**NOTE:** If you have an antivirus installed, it is possible it flags the b.exe executable as a virus and deletes it automatically. If this happens, you will need to reinstall it and, using the configuration panel of your anitvirus, white-list it or simply tell your antivirus not to flag it.
