### What it's about
Program which, given a set of atoms will generate molecular structures ordered in terms of likeliness to occur in the real world (not insanely accurately though!). This program can be used as a teaching aid because it allows the user to move the molecule around/ the individual atoms around, compare it to others molecules, as well as to save them in preparation for the class!

### Running it
To properly run this application (located in the **RELEASE** folder):
1. JRE must be installed on the computer running it
2. Run the **ChemicalSimulator.exe** file
3. If there is an error or you just see the logo then nothing, run the **ChemicalSimulator.bat** file

**NOTE 1:** If you have an antivirus installed, it is possible it flags the b.exe executable as a virus and deletes it automatically. If this happens, you will need to reinstall it and, using the configuration panel of your anitvirus, white-list it or simply tell your antivirus not to flag it.

**NOTE 2:** Linux's OpenJFX seems quite buggy and unstable, this application only seems to work on Windows.
